WELCOME  NEW TO OUR NOT SO AWESOME SERVER

  A SERVER FOR ARTIST, GAMERS, STUDY, AND MORE!

fun fact: the owner can't decide a name for the server so they would change it A LOT

WHY IS IT NOT SO AWESOME?

It's new! Dead chat here, dead chat there, dead chat 24/7 (no its not)
want me to give you a pro tip? join the server to become one with the not so awesome people

WHAT MAKES IT AWESOME?

Everything! We've got self roles, dead chat, bots that even the staff don't know how to use them, an admin that complains how terrible the server is 24/7, channels that have never been used, dead chat, awesome people, dead chat, confusing bots, dead chat, oh and here's the best part. Dead chat!

𝙵𝙾𝚁 𝙰𝚁𝚃𝙸𝚂𝚃
